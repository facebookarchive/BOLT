/// LongJmp is veneer-insertion pass originally written for AArch64 that
/// compensates for its short-range branches, typically done during linking. We
/// pull this pass inside BOLT because here we can do a better job at stub
/// inserting by manipulating the CFG, something linkers can't do.
///
/// LongJmp is a two-step process. In the first step, when function sizes are
/// still unknown because we can insert an arbitrary amount of code to reach
/// far-away code, this pass expands all PC-relative instructions that refer to
/// a symbol at an unknown location likely to violate the branch range.
/// This expansion inserts the equivalent of "linker stubs", small
/// blocks of code that load a 64-bit address into a pre-allocated register and
//  then executes an unconditional indirect branch on this register. By using a
/// 64-bit range, we guarantee it can reach any code location.
///
/// In the second step, we iteratively repeat the following until no
/// modification is done: we do a tentative layout with the current function
/// sizes; then we remove stubs for branches that we know are close enough to be
/// encoded in a direct branch or a smaller stub (32-bit).
///
/// Notice that this iteration is possible since step 2 strictly reduces sizes
/// and distances between branches and their destinations.
